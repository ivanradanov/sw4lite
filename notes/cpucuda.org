* 
had to tag GridPointSource::getFxyz and getFxyztt as __host__ __device__

* 
Had to work around the min/max cuda-mode clang bug

* 
Why is __device__ rhs4lower_dev in [src/device-routines.C] not used anywhere and
why is it declared in [src/device-routines.h] as __global__ ?

I don't know but for now I changed the definitions to __global__ to avoid a bug
in cpucuda (device functions should become static always-inline which doesnt
happen in this case for some reason, perhaps because of the declaration?)

* 
-ccbin option does not exist in clang, maybe add a dummy one which does nothing
